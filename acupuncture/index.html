      <h1>About Acupuncture</h1>
      <p>
        Acupuncture is a vital part of Chinese medicine, the oldest system of
        health care known. It regulates the body's ability to heal through the
        stimulation of different sites on the body with a very fine needle. For
        the patient, the response produces decreasing symptoms that last for
        increasingly longer amounts of time. The World Health Organization
        recognizes acupuncture and traditional Oriental medicine's ability to
        treat over 200 commonly encountered clinical disorders. Acupuncture has
        also been recognized as supportive therapy for many other chronic and
        painful debilitating disorders.

        At Amasia, you will learn if acupuncture is an appropriate treatment for
        your condition during your first visit. A specific number of treatments
        will be recommended to serve as a trial to determine if your case will
        respond to acupuncture. You will also gain a better understanding of
        ways to assess your progress and when to expect results.

        Why do individuals choose acupuncture?
      </h3>
      <p>
        At Amasia, we understand why most of our patients seek help from our
        acupuncture clinic. Many seek acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy to
        enhance the health care they are receiving or because standard
        therapies, medications and treatments have been ineffective. Others are
        looking for a more natural treatment as a way to regain control of their
        own health. Whatever your reason might be, we will treat you in a way we
        like to be treated ourselves. Today more people than ever seek help from
        acupuncture because it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relieves pain</li>
        <li>Helps normalize functional disorders</li>
        <li>Alleviates nausea</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="what-is-a-typical-treatment-like">
        What is a typical treatment like?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Your treatment will typically last between 20-30 minutes. You will then
        be asked to relax while the practitioner performs the treatment. During
        a typical treatment you will experience minute disposable needles being
        gently inserted into the skin at specific sites on the body. Because
        they are extremely thin you will usually only feel a slight sensation.
        Occasionally either manual rotation or electrical stimulation generating
        a soft, painless current is applied to add additional stimulation.
        Often, a feeling of pleasant relaxation or general well-being follows a
        treatment.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-can-i-expect-from-a-visit-to-amasia-clinic">
        What can I expect from a visit to Amasia Clinic?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Your case will be approached in a sensible and practical way. Each
        acupuncture visit will start with a brief discussion of your condition
        with the acupuncturist. We will start with a treatment-trial to
        determine if acupuncture will work for you. As the treatments progress a
        cumulative response should be realized, with subsequent treatments
        scheduled accordingly. Depending on your condition, there are a variety
        of techniques that may be used in your treatment in addition to
        acupuncture. Please see our
        <a href="/services/" title="Go to Services page">Services</a> page for
        more information about the treatments and services we offer.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-kind-of-needles-do-you-use">
        What kind of needles do you use?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Your safety and well-being is our primary concern. We use the
        highest-quality disposable equipment available. We use fine surgical
        steel needles. Each needle is used only once and then properly disposed
        of. This practice eliminates the possibility of transmitting a
        communicable disease by a contaminated needle. Acupuncture is an
        extremely safe therapeutic procedure, with our experience and training
        in our profession, ensures that you are being given the best care
        possible.

        What does acupuncture feel like?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Acupuncture is virtually painless and the experienced hands at Amasia
        Acupuncture clinic also helps make the whole treatment pleasant.
        Acupuncture bears no resemblance to the feeling of receiving an
        injection since the main source of pain from injections is the larger
        diameter, hollow needle and the medication being forced into the tissue
        by pressure. Acupuncture needles are very fine and flexible, about the
        diameter of a thick hair. In most cases, insertion by a skilled
        practitioner can be inserted without the discomfort that is typically
        associated with needles. However, if the practitioner has obtained the
        correct stimulus of the needle, the patient should feel a dull ache,
        heaviness, distention, tingling, or electrical sensation either around
        the needle or traveling up or down the affected meridian. These
        sensations are the presence and movement of Qi. Despite these
        sensations, most patients find the treatments very relaxing and many
        fall asleep during the treatments.
