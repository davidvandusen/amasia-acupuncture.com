        <h2>About Chiropractics</h2>
        <p>
          The modern profession of chiropractic was founded by Daniel David
          Palmer in 1895 in Davenport, Iowa.
          <a

          >
          Chiropractic doctors work in this health care profession focusing on
          the relationship between the body structure and it's function.
          Different practitioners may use a variety of treatments and
          approaches, but most primarily perform adjustments (also called
          manipulations) to various parts of the body to correct alignment
          problems, alleviating pain, free pinched nerves, etc. People who
          generally seek chiropractic care seek it primarily for pain conditions
          such as back pain, neck pain, headache, and extremity (e.g., hand or
          foot) problems.

        <p>
          There will be an initial consultation to discuss the patient's
          condition. Based on the condition, we will give a diagnosis and the
          appropriate treatment protocols starting from the first visit and in
          the follow-up visits. Number of visits varies for every individual,
          but there will be a re-evaluation at least every 4-weeks to ensure the
          patient is well on their way to recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every visit lasts from an hour to one-and-a-half hours with treatments
          and protocols.
