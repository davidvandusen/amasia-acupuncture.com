      <h1>About Chinese Medicinal Herbs</h1>
      <p>
        Chinese medicinal herbs has been a key aspect in Traditional Chinese
        Medicine (TCM) for over 5,000 years. According to the World Health
        Organization, "In some Asian and African countries, 80% of the
        population depend on traditional medicine for primary health care. In
        many developed countries, 70% to 80% of the population has used some
        form of alternative or complementary medicine (e.g. acupuncture)" (<a

        How is traditional Chinese Medicine different from Western Medicine?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps the biggest difference between Chinese and Western Medicine is
        that Chinese Medicine relies on experience over time through numerous
        trials and clinical observations and Western Medicine is based on
        standards and evidence. Many western consumers who are seeking natural,
        healthy and balanced alternatives to Western Medicine, find Chinese
        Medicine.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-is-chinese-medicine-made-of">
        What is Chinese Medicine made of?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Ingredients of Chinese Medicine are primarily of plant origin (such as
        roots, bark, seeds, flowers, and leaves), and in their natural form.
        Ingredients that are not of plant origin Amasia Clinic does not usually
        use and in the rare circumstance that there are non-plant ingredients,
        we make sure to inform our patients.
      </p>
      <h3 id="is-chinese-medicine-a-replacement-for-western-medicine">
        Is Chinese Medicine a replacement for Western Medicine?
      </h3>
      <p>
        No, Chinese herbs should be viewed only as a supplement to western
        medicine, and not as a replacement, in many circumstances. However,
        cooperation between practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine and
        Western Medicine and the use of Western diagnostic tools in TCM are
        increasing. Many Traditional Chinese medical schools require training in
        Western medicine as well as TCM, training Chinese Medicinal doctors that
        have a good understanding of Western Medicine as well as their
        specialized field.
